## What is AWS Lambda?

AWS Lambda lets you run code without managing servers. You just upload your code, and AWS runs it for you. You only pay when your code runs!

**Think of it like:** Ordering food delivery instead of cooking - you get what you need without doing all the work.

## Function 1: Hello World Lambda (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Sign In to AWS Console

1. Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com
2. Sign in with your credentials
3. Make sure you're in **US East (N. Virginia)** region (top-right corner)

### Step 2: Open Lambda Service

1. Click the **search bar** at the top
2. Type **Lambda**
3. Click **Lambda** from the results

### Step 3: Create Your First Function

1. Click **Create function** (orange button)
2. Select **Author from scratch**
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Function name:** `hello-world-yourname` (replace yourname with your actual name)
   - **Runtime:** Select **Python 3.11**
   - **Architecture:** Leave as **x86_64**
4. Click **Create function** (bottom right)

**Wait 5-10 seconds** for AWS to create your function.

### Step 4: Add Your Code

1. Scroll down to the **Code source** section
2. You'll see a file called `lambda_function.py`
3. **Delete all the existing code**
4. Copy and paste this code:

```python
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    """
    Basic Hello World Lambda function
    Returns a simple greeting message
    """
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps({
            'message': 'Hello from Lambda!',
            'event': event
        })
    }
```

5. Click **Deploy** (orange button above the code)
6. Wait for the message: "Successfully updated the function"

### Step 5: Test Your Function

1. Click the **Test** tab (next to Code)
2. Click **Create new event**
3. Fill in:
   - **Event name:** `test1`
   - Leave the JSON as is (or replace with):
   ```json
   {
     "name": "John",
     "message": "Testing my first Lambda!"
   }
   ```
4. Click **Save**
5. Click **Test** (orange button)

**You should see:**
- Green box with "Execution result: succeeded"
- Your response with "Hello from Lambda!"
- Execution time and memory used

**Congratulations!** You just ran your first Lambda function! 🎉
